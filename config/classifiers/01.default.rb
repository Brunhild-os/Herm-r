# WarVOX Classifiers
#

#
# These lightweight signatures are used to determine the
# line type, which is the top-level classification that
# differentiates between modem, fax, voice, and other
# common results.
#


#
# If you want to force your checks to run first, add your
# logic to a file starting with "00." and place it in
# this directory. Signature files are processed numerically
# from lowest to highest (like RC scripts)
#


#
# Initialize some local variables out of data

freq = data[:freq]
fcnt = data[:fcnt]
maxf = data[:maxf]

#
# Look for modems by detecting a 2100hz answer + 2250hz tone

# Look for modems by detecting a peak frequency of 2250hz

#
if(fcnt[2100] > 1.0 and (maxf > 2995.0 and maxf < 3005.0))
